<title>Implementation Specifics</title>
<para>
The implementation of the package is based on the LFC C-api. All the
access to the LFC name server are perfomed within non-named,
serialized transactions. The I/O operations are perfomed with calls
to the corresponding LFC functions, handling the error condition by
translating the LFC error codes in specific run time exceptions.
The functionality of the component are provided by a single service,
implementing the features of replica lookup and credential store,
and the administration commands for the deployment and operation of
the database catalogue.
The access to the LFC entries for administration and lookup is
protected by the LFC built-in file system access permission. In
particular,
autorization to specific grid-roles or grid-groups is managed with
LFC ACL's.

<sect3><title>Mapping of CORAL database catalogue information to LFC
tables</title>
<para>
The mapping between the database-related information and the LFC data
fields is well isolated in a single, specific class, allowing for easy
modification of the schema with little impact on the rest of the
software architecture. 
Here follows the table describing the mapping.
