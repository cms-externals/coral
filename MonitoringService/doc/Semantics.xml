  <para>
  The monitoring service is not used directly by application code but
  rather steered via user level IMonitoring interface. Only CORAL
  plugins use this service directly to record any monitoring event
  when it happens.

  <para>
  The events recording may happen at different levels configurable via
  coral::IMonitoring user level interface. The level determines the
  granurality of the recored information from informational up to the
  low level details about various steps performed by CORAL plugins to
  be used mostly for debugging purposes.
